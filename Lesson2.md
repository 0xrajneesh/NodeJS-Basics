# Introduction to Node Modules

## ðŸ”·Global Objects

Global Objects can be used in any files such as

```javascript

console.log(); // Console is Global Object

setImmediate() // It schedules the immediate execution of the callback.

clearImmediate() // It stops the immediate object returned by the setImmediate() method.

setInterval() // executes the callback function at repeated intervals

setTimeout() // to run a callback function after at least delay in milliseconds.

```

## ðŸ”·Modules

To avoid yoru function defination getting override with function in another file, we tend to avoid function with global scope rather we use modular approach.

Modules are nothing a File.
