# Introduction to NodeJS

## 🔷What is Node?

Node is an open-source runtime enviornment for executing Javascript code outside of a browser.

It is used to build the API(Application prgramming Interface) to enable client application like Web App and Mobile App to talk to Back-end services.

## 🔷But Why NodeJS?
There are several back-end frameworks and modeuls such as Django, ASP.NET still NodeJS popular because of three reasons:

<!-- UL -->
* **Fast and highly scalable🚀**: Used by organizations such Paypal, Uber, Wallmart etc
* **Use JavaScript👨‍💻**: It allows front-end developers who know JavaScript, it's easy for them to get started with a brand new projects and also get them grow their career faster.
* **Benefits of Large Open-Source Libs🙌**: NodeJS has got the largest ecosystem of open-source code on Github as a result, you get better support.

## 🔷Node Architecture

In 2009, Ryal Dahl(creator of Node) thought why if we can take out Javascript from client-side and run it on server side to deliver same flexibility.

So he took Google Chrome v8 JavaScript Engine and embedded inside a C++ code and named this program Node.exe.

## 🔷Capabilities of NodeJS

We cant use document or window object such as



~~document.getElementById()~~

Instead, we have objects:


```javascript

fs.access(path[, mode], callback) // access file
dir.path //  read-only path of this directory
dir.read() // Asynchronously read 
os.hostname() // Returns the host name
os.platform() // Returns a string identifying the operating system platform


```
